LyricLeech

This web-app was built for fun by myself, John Zdanis :

I noticed that my facebook friends would often post song lyrics as status updates,
and thought, why not build an web-app just for that? So I did.


It was named "Lyric Leech" by suggestion of my friend,Joshua Nelson

There were many other suggestions as well, but this was the only one with a '.com' avaiable.
